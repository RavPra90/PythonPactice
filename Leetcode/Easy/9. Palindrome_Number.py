LEETCODE PROBLEM: 9. Palindrome Number
========================================
Problem Statement:
Given an integer x, return true if x is a palindrome integer.
An integer is a palindrome when it reads the same backward as forward.

Example:
Input: x = 121
Output: true
Explanation: 121 reads as 121 from left to right and from right to left.

Input: x = -121
Output: false
Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.

Input: x = 10
Output: false
Explanation: Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore it is not a palindrome.

ALGORITHM EXPLANATION:
================================================================
Steps for Mathematical Approach (Approach 2):

1. Handle Edge Cases:
   - Negative numbers: Always return False (they can't be palindromes)
   - Single digits: Always return True (0-9 are palindromes)
   - Numbers ending with 0: Return False (except for 0 itself)

2. Reverse the Number:
   - Use modulo (%) to get the last digit
   - Use integer division (//) to remove the last digit
   - Build the reversed number by multiplying by 10 and adding the new digit

3. Compare:
   - Check if the original number equals the reversed number

Example Walkthrough for x = 121:
- original = 121, reversed_num = 0
- Iteration 1: last_digit = 1, reversed_num = 0*10 + 1 = 1, x = 12
- Iteration 2: last_digit = 2, reversed_num = 1*10 + 2 = 12, x = 1  
- Iteration 3: last_digit = 1, reversed_num = 12*10 + 1 = 121, x = 0
- Compare: 121 == 121 â†’ True

Learning Points:
================================================================
1. String Manipulation: Converting numbers to strings for easy reversal
2. Mathematical Operations: Using modulo (%) and integer division (//) to extract digits
3. Edge Case Handling: Considering negative numbers, single digits, and trailing zeros
4. Optimization: The half-reversal approach reduces time complexity
5. Multiple Solution Approaches: Same problem can be solved in different ways with different trade-offs
6. Time vs Space Complexity: String approach uses more space but is easier to understand

Key Takeaways for Future Problems:
- Always consider edge cases first
- Mathematical approaches often use less space than string conversions
- Digit manipulation using % and // is a common technique in number-based problems
- Sometimes you can optimize by processing only part of the data (half-reversal approach)
